# Hoohack2023
## Description
This is our project for HooHack 2023, With focus in Sustainable IT.

## Project Description
This is a Website that collects information about food waste around campuses, this website checks for statistic on how much food (in pounds) is wasted each week. This website also has a polling system that decides what will be on the menu the following week. The dining hall staff members will have full control on which meal will be in the poll depending on the inventory. Not only does the polling system encourage students to participate it also help re-evaluate unpopular meals to satisfy the students and staff members. 

Our website will have: 

To raise awareness
- a monthly report of how much food is wasted each week.
- a yearly report of how much food is wasted each month.

To increase sustainability
- a voting system by student and staff for next weeks menu. 
- data for office of sustainability to use to cut servings on unpopular meals and add servings in popular meals.

## How to start
- Please install Live server extension in Visual studios and launch the code using it

# About the project

## Inspiration
We took inspiration from the UN SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), UVA's 2020 Sustainability Plan to reduce waste to 30%, as well as the amount of food waste that we saw at the event itself. So we decided to tackle food waste during the HooHacks 2023 event.

## What it does
The website is meant to compile and report data based on how much food waste is produced by a university in general and based on the kinds of food items it uses in its menus. Displaying the information helps to raise awareness about food waste at universities, but our idea was also that, if students could vote on what they wanted to eat, then they would be more likely to actually eat the food provided, reducing the amount of wasted food. We should note that most of the data on our current website are completely made up as an example.

## How we built it
We built our website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, and a little JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
Our initial challenge was actually just coming up with an idea that we thought was meaningful enough to do but reasonable enough to accomplish, given we were all first-time hackers. We also initially had some issues with our voting form but we resolved them with Google forms implementation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to complete the project on time,  given this was the first time we'd done something like this under this kind of time constraint.

## What we learned
We've learned that web development is more difficult or at least time-consuming than we initially gave it credit for.

## What's next for Mindful Meals Project
If we continue with the project, it would be helpful to actually implement a database to use and store the data for analytics diagrams in the website.
