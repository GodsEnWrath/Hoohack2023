This is a Website that collects information about food waste around campuses, this website checks for statistic on how much food (in pounds) is wasted each week. This website also has a polling system that decides what will be on the menu the following week.

Not only does the polling system encourage students to participate it also help re-evaluate unpopular meals to satisfy the students and staff members.
