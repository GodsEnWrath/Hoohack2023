## Description

## Project Description
This is a Website that collects information about food waste around campuses, this website checks for statistic on how much food (in pounds) is wasted each week. This website also has a polling system that decides what will be on the menu the following week. The dining hall staff members will have full control on which meal will be in the poll depending on the inventory. Not only does the polling system encourage students to participate it also help re-evaluate unpopular meals to satisfy the students and staff members. 

Our website will have: 
To raise awareness: 
- a monthly report of how much food is wasted each week.
- a yearly report of how much food is wasted each month.
To increase sustainability: 
- a voting system by student and staff for next weeks menu. 
- data for office of sustainability to use to cut servings on unpopular meals and add servings in popular meals.
